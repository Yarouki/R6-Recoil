## üìù Usage

In this program, X and Y values help control your weapon‚Äôs recoil by adjusting your aim to counter the gun‚Äôs kick.

X (Horizontal):
- Adjusts side-to-side aim to counter left or right recoil.
- Positive X (e.g., 0.5): Moves right to fight leftward drift.
- Negative X (e.g., -0.5): Moves left to fight rightward drift.
- Use it: Tweak X if your crosshair drifts sideways while firing.

Y (Vertical):
- Adjusts up-and-down aim to counter upward recoil.
- Higher Y (e.g., 9.0): Pulls down more for high-recoil guns. Like Twitch F2 or Smoke Smg 11
- Lower Y (e.g., 4.5): Pulls down less for milder recoil. Like Sledge's L85A2
- Use it: Increase Y if your crosshair climbs too high; decrease if it pulls down too much.

How They Work:
- X and Y move your mouse automatically when you hold both mouse buttons (shooting and aiming) to keep your crosshair steady. Set them per operator and scope (1x or 2.5x) in the preset menu.

High Sensitivity Mode:
- If you use high in-game sensitivity (e.g., 12), enable this in Settings to scale down X and Y effects, preventing overcorrection.

Tips:
- Adjust X and Y in small steps in the ‚ÄúEdit Preset‚Äù menu.
- Test in the shooting range to see how your crosshair moves.
- Customize for each operator‚Äôs gun and scope.
- Fine-tune X and Y to make your aim smoother and keep shots on target!
- Right click on a operator to favorite!
- Make custom Hotkeys in Settings!
